			Did you mean: She just wanted to talk, she's gonna miss you
			<br>Girl I'm Gonna Miss You
	  </p>

		<p>
			She Wants YOU to Talk to HER
			<br>Do NOT MISS This ...
			<br>People also ask
			<br>What does it mean if she says she misses you?
		</p>

		<p>
			When a guy says he misses you what does it mean?
			<br>How do you tell if she's thinking about you?
			<br>Does missing someone mean you love them?
		</p>

		<p>
			Women Say They Are Really Into You
			<br>she wants to be your listening ear, make it clear
		</p>

		<p>
			This Is When You're Gonna Miss Her Most
			<br>no matter how hard she tried, you never were saying anything
		</p>

		<p>
			Even If She Won't Be The First To Say It, She Misses You
			<br>we wish we could say something, but we don't
			<br>she misses you
		</p>

		<p>
			believe that she was able to voice out
			<br>you say it
			<br>tell her
			<br>I miss you
		</p>

		<p>
			I haven't seen her, Haha probably her car broke down
			<br>I wanted to know who knocked her off.
			<br>I should call the now?
